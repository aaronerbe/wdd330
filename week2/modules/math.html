  // after you have seen that the sqRoot code below does not work.

  // you will see that the variable num is also not visible between script blocks either
  // it is as if the script tag inserts an opening and closing set of curly braces around the code,
  // thus scope blocking everything in the tag

  //  looking in the console you will see that this code does not work

  //  What are your thoughts on why that is?

  //  it seems like if we imported the file from above it would still be visible
  //  but that is not how modules work. The SCOPE of the imports is just in that script tag
